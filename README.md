### Question
Write a multithreaded program that implements the banker's algorithm.
Create n threads that request and release resources from the bank.
The banker will grant the request only if it leaves the system in a safe state.
It is important that shared data be safe from concurrent access.
To ensure safe access to shared data, you can use mutex locks.

### Solution

 - [Multithreaded Implementation In C](./bankers_algorithm.c)

### TODO
 
 - Input Parsing
 - Safe Sequence Find
 - Threads
 - Makefile
